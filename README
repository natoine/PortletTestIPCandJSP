This project was done to test IPC (Inter Portlet Communication) through eventing between two portlets (PortletSendEvent and PortletReceptEvent) when these portlets are embedded in a JSP.
You will need to use the sun portlet container.
Installation of sun portlet container and how to include a portlet in a JSP is described here : http://portlet-container.java.net/public/UserGuide.html
The project provides a version of portletdriver.jar but you should use the one you'll get through your own installation of the portlet container.
